To test the \u201cknee-jerk\u201d reflex, a doctor taps the patellar tendon below the kneecap with a\nrubber hammer. The stimulation of the nerves there leads to the reflex of extending the leg at the knee. This is similar to\nthe reaction of someone who touches a hot stove and instinctually pulls his or her hand away. Even humans, with our great\ncapacity to learn, still exhibit a variety of innate behaviors.\nKinesis and Taxis\nAnother activity or movement of innate behavior is kinesis , or the undirected movement in response to a stimulus.\nOrthokinesis is the increased or decreased speed of movement of an organism in response to a stimulus. Woodlice, for\nexample, increase their speed of movement when exposed to high or low temperatures. This movement, although random,\nincreases the probability that the insect spends less time in the unfavorable environment. Another example is klinokinesis,", "time, the baby reorients, facing forward and down with the back or crown of the head engaging the cervix (uterine opening).\nThis causes the cervix to stretch and nerve impulses are sent to the hypothalamus, which signals for the release of oxytocin\nfrom the posterior pituitary. The oxytocin causes the smooth muscle in the uterine wall to contract. At the same time, the\nplacenta releases prostaglandins into the uterus, increasing the contractions. A positive feedback relay occurs between the\nuterus, hypothalamus, and the posterior pituitary to assure an adequate supply of oxytocin. As more smooth muscle cells\nare recruited, the contractions increase in intensity and force.Chapter 34 | Animal Reproduction and Development 1521"], ["dendrites .

Nodes contain voltage-gated K+and Na+\nchannels. Action potentials travel down the axon by jumping from one node to the next.\nSynaptic Transmission\nThe synapse or \u201cgap\u201d is the place where information is transmitted from one neuron to another. Synapses usually form\nbetween axon terminals and dendritic spines, but this is not universally true. There are also axon-to-axon, dendrite-to-\ndendrite, and axon-to-cell body synapses. The neuron transmitting the signal is called the presynaptic neuron, and the\nneuron receiving the signal is called the postsynaptic neuron. Note that these designations are relative to a particular\nsynapse\u2014most neurons are both presynaptic and postsynaptic. There are two types of synapses: chemical and electrical.\nChemical Synapse\nWhen an action potential reaches the axon terminal it depolarizes the membrane and opens voltage-gated Na+channels.", "Neurotransmitter Example Location\nAcetylcholine \u2014 CNS and/or PNS\nBiogenic amine Dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine CNS and/or PNS\nAmino acid Glycine, glutamate, aspartate, gamma aminobutyric acid CNS\nNeuropeptide Substance P, endorphins CNS and/or PNS\nTable 26.2\nElectrical Synapse\nWhile electrical synapses are fewer in number than chemical synapses, they are found in all nervous systems and play\nimportant and unique roles. The mode of neurotransmission in electrical synapses is quite different from that in chemical\nsynapses. In an electrical synapse, the presynaptic and postsynaptic membranes are very close together and are actually\nphysically connected by channel proteins forming gap junctions. Gap junctions allow current to pass directly from one cell\nto the next. In addition to the ions that carry this current, other molecules, such as ATP, can diffuse through the large gap\njunction pores.", "structure, the axon hillock that integrates signals from multiple synapses and serves as a junction between the cell body and\nan axon. An axon is a tube-like structure that propagates the integrated signal to specialized endings called axon terminals .\nThese terminals in turn synapse on other neurons, muscle, or target organs. Chemicals released at axon terminals allow\nsignals to be communicated to these other cells. Neurons usually have one or two axons, but some neurons, like amacrine\ncells in the retina, do not contain any axons. Some axons are covered with myelin, which acts as an insulator to minimize\ndissipation of the electrical signal as it travels down the axon, greatly increasing the speed on conduction. This insulation is\nimportant as the axon from a human motor neuron can be as long as a meter\u2014from the base of the spine to the toes. The\nmyelin sheath is not actually part of the neuron. Myelin is produced by glial cells. Along the axon there are periodic gaps in"], ["algebra s tudents in a p articular city .

Classical conditioning is a major tenet of behaviorism, a branch of psychological philosophy that\nproposes that all actions, thoughts, and emotions of living things are behaviors that can be treated by behavior modification\nand changes in the environment.\nOperant Conditioning\nInoperant conditioning , the conditioned behavior is gradually modified by its consequences as the animal responds to the\nstimulus. A major proponent of such conditioning was psychologist B.F. Skinner, the inventor of the Skinner box. Skinner\nput rats in his boxes that contained a lever that would dispense food to the rat when depressed. While initially the rat would\npush the lever a few times by accident, it eventually associated pushing the lever with getting the food. This type of learning", "frequency.\nClassical Conditioning\nInclassical conditioning , a response called the conditioned response is associated with a stimulus that it had previously\nnot been associated with, the conditioned stimulus. The response to the original, unconditioned stimulus is called the\nunconditioned response. The most cited example of classical conditioning is Ivan Pavlov\u2019s experiments with dogs (Figure\n36.41). In Pavlov\u2019s experiments, the unconditioned response was the salivation of dogs in response to the unconditioned\nstimulus of seeing or smelling their food. The conditioning stimulus that researchers associated with the unconditioned\nresponse was the ringing of a bell. During conditioning, every time the animal was given food, the bell was rung. This wasChapter 36 | Population and Community Ecology 1645", "repeated during several trials. After some time, the dog learned to associate the ringing of the bell with food and to respond\nby salivating. After the conditioning period was finished, the dog would respond by salivating when the bell was rung,\neven when the unconditioned stimulus, the food, was absent. Thus, the ringing of the bell became the conditioned stimulus\nand the salivation became the conditioned response. Although it is thought by some scientists that the unconditioned\nand conditioned responses are identical, even Pavlov discovered that the saliva in the conditioned dogs had characteristic\ndifferences when compared to the unconditioned dog.\nFigure 36.41 In the classic Pavlovian response, the dog becomes conditioned to associate the ringing of the bell with\nfood.\nIt had been thought by some scientists that this type of conditioning required multiple exposures to the paired stimulus", "a. In operant conditioning, the animal learns to\nassociate a voluntary behavior with its\nconsequences, whereas in classical conditioning,\nthe animal learns to associate a non-voluntary\nbehavior with an unusual stimulus.\nb. In operant conditioning, the animal does not\nlearn a new behavior in response to a stimulus,\nwhereas in classical conditioning, the animal\nlearns to associate a non-voluntary behavior with\nan unusual stimulus.\nc. In operant conditioning, the animal learns to\nassociate a voluntary behavior with its\nconsequences, whereas in classical conditioning,\nthe animal does not learn a new behavior in\nresponse to a stimulus.\nd.

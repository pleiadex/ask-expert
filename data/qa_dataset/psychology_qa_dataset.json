Information traveling up the spinal cord to the brain is directed to one of the specialized areas of the cerebrum;\nfor example, association areas for hearing are localized in the temporal lobe. The cerebellum helps coordinate skeletal\nmuscle activity, and the medulla oblongata and pons in the brainstem are centers for vital functions, such as breathing and\nheart rate. Although localization of functions occurs, most complex functions, like language, involve neurons in multiple\nbrain regions. In terms of energy, since the brain consumes about 20 percent of the body\u2019s resources (ATP), is it any\nwonder that you\u2019re exhausted after taking an AP\u00aetest? Information from the brain travels down the spinal cord, making", "circadian rhythms, sometimes called sleep cycles.\nLimbic System\nThelimbic system is a connected set of structures that regulates emotion, as well as behaviors related to fear and motivation.\nIt plays a role in memory formation and includes parts of the thalamus and hypothalamus as well as the hippocampus.\nOne important structure within the limbic system is a temporal lobe structure called the amygdala (Greek for \u201calmond\u201d),\nillustrated in Figure 26.24. The two amygdala are important both for the sensation of fear and for recognizing fearful faces.\nThecingulate gyrus helps regulate emotions and pain.\nCerebellum\nThe cerebellum (Latin for \u201clittle brain\u201d), shown in Figure 26.21, sits at the base of the brain on top of the brainstem. The\ncerebellum controls balance and aids in coordinating movement and learning new motor tasks.\nBrainstem\nThe brainstem, illustrated in Figure 26.21, connects the rest of the brain with the spinal cord. It consists of the midbrain,", "medulla oblongata, and the pons. Motor and sensory neurons extend through the brainstem allowing for the relay of signals\nbetween the brain and spinal cord. Ascending neural pathways cross in this section of the brain allowing the left hemisphere\nof the cerebrum to control the right side of the body and vice versa. The brainstem coordinates motor control signals sent\nfrom the brain to the body. The brainstem controls several important functions of the body including alertness, arousal,\nbreathing, blood pressure, digestion, heart rate, swallowing, walking, and sensory and motor information integration.Chapter 26 | The Nervous System 1135", "chemical messengers associated with the immune response\ncan cause chronic pain.\nUnlike local anesthetics general anesthetics block signaltransduction of the entire central nervous system and the\nbrain.

Overall, the research shows high relevance for attachment characteristics in group treatment, a finding that should encourage group leaders to attend to the influence of attachment goals on group members\u2019 behavior and the impact of attachment characteristics on members\u2019 willingness to engage with and stay in the group. In the new edition of the Handbook (2), the evidence on group therapy is summarized according to the highest level of evidence-based research, allowing for specification of direction and strength of differences between treatment conditions (7), calculation of overall effect, and estimation of heterogeneity on individual study effects (8). Despite this paucity in the group literature, a wide range of methods is available to continuously and economically monitor the effects of group treatment on individuals\u2019 symptomatology and other changes, as well as on group-specific elements (e.g., the quality of relationships between group members and member-leader). For example, \u201callegiance,\u201d defined as the researcher\u2019s belief in the superiority of a treatment (risk of allegiance bias lowers the effects of head-to-head comparisons in anxiety disorders) (18), group size (larger groups lead to lower effects when working with patients with borderline personality disorder) (15), and specific diagnosis (larger effects on binge eating frequency seen in binge eating disorders compared with bulimia) (12) are significant moderators."], ["falsifiable able to b e dispro ven b y experimental results\ngeneraliz einferring tha t the results f or a sample apply to the larg er p opula tion\nhypothesis (plural: h ypotheses) tenta tive and tes table s tatement a bout the rela tionship b etween tw o or more\nvaria bles\nillusor y correlat ion seeing rela tionships b etween tw o things when in re ality no such rela tionship e xists\nindep endent v ariable varia ble tha t is influenc ed or c ontrolle d by the e xperimenter; in a sound e xperimental\nstudy , the indep endent v aria ble is the only imp ortant diff erenc e between the e xperimental and c ontrol\ngroup\ninduct ive re asoning conclusions are dra wn from obser vations\ninforme d consent process of inf orming a rese arch p articip ant a bout wha t to e xpect during an e xperiment ,\nany risks in volved, and the implic ations o f the rese arch , and then obtaining the p erson \u2019s consent to\nparticip ate", "Figure 1.6 The scientific method consists of a series of well-defined steps.

Chemicals released at axon terminals allow\nsignals to be communicated to these other cells.

Some axons are covered with myelin, which acts as an insulator to minimize\ndissipation of the electrical signal as it travels down the axon, greatly increasing the speed on conduction. This insulation is\nimportant as the axon from a human motor neuron can be as long as a meter\u2014from the base of the spine to the toes. The\nmyelin sheath is not actually part of the neuron.

After some time, the dog learned to associate the ringing of the bell with food and to respond\nby salivating. After the conditioning period was finished, the dog would respond by salivating when the bell was rung,\neven when the unconditioned stimulus, the food, was absent. Thus, the ringing of the bell became the conditioned stimulus\nand the salivation became the conditioned response. Although it is thought by some scientists that the unconditioned\nand conditioned responses are identical, even Pavlov discovered that the saliva in the conditioned dogs had characteristic\ndifferences when compared to the unconditioned dog.\nFigure 36.41 In the classic Pavlovian response, the dog becomes conditioned to associate the ringing of the bell with\nfood.\nIt had been thought by some scientists that this type of conditioning required multiple exposures to the paired stimulus", "and response, but it is now known that this is not necessary in all cases, and that some conditioning can be learned in a\nsingle pairing experiment. Classical conditioning is a major tenet of behaviorism, a branch of psychological philosophy that\nproposes that all actions, thoughts, and emotions of living things are behaviors that can be treated by behavior modification\nand changes in the environment.\nOperant Conditioning\nInoperant conditioning , the conditioned behavior is gradually modified by its consequences as the animal responds to the\nstimulus. A major proponent of such conditioning was psychologist B.F. Skinner, the inventor of the Skinner box. Skinner\nput rats in his boxes that contained a lever that would dispense food to the rat when depressed. While initially the rat would\npush the lever a few times by accident, it eventually associated pushing the lever with getting the food.

However, the\nloss of internal equilibrium due to positive feedback can be detrimental; for example, a small area of damaged heart tissue\ncan precipitate a heart attack which, in turn, damages even more cardiac muscle.\nInformation presented and the examples highlighted in the section support concepts outlined in Big Idea 2 of the AP", "neuromuscular and a utonomic activity \u2014feedback is pro vide d in the f orm o f visual or a uditor y signals .

This process determines the type and intensity of the emotional response. Cognitive interpretation is the first step in the emotional process as described by the two-factor theory.\nThe two-factor theory of emotion, also known as the Schachter-Singer theory, offers a comprehensive perspective on the complex nature of human emotions. Proposed by researchers Stanley Schachter and Jerome Singer in the 1960s, this theory posits that emotions are the result of two factors: physiological arousal and cognitive interpretation.\nAccording to the Schachter-Singer theory of emotion, developed in 1962, there are two key components of an emotion: physical arousal and a cognitive label. In other words, the experience of emotion involves first having some kind of physiological response which the mind then identifies. Many cognitive theories of emotion emerged during the ...\nOctober 29, 2023. Reviewed by. Olivia Guy-Evans, MSc. The Schachter-Singer theory, often called the two-factor theory of emotion, proposes that a combination of physiological arousal and cognitive interpretation determines emotions. This theory was developed by psychologists Stanley Schachter and Jerome E. Singer in the 1960s.\nSchachter and Singer's (1962) Two-Factor Theory of Emotion suggests that physiological arousal determines the strength of the emotion, while cognitive appraisal identifies the emotion label. So, in this theory, the \"two-factor\" represents physiological change and cognitive appraisal change.

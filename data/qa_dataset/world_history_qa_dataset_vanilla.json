Geochemical cycles are characterized by the movement of elements.\nThe Water (Hydrologic) Cycle\nWater is the basis of all living processes. The human body is more than 1/2 water and human cells are more than 70 percent\nwater. Thus, most land animals need a supply of fresh water to survive. However, when examining the stores of water on\nEarth, 97.5 percent of it is non-potable salt water (Figure 37.13). Of the remaining water, 99 percent is locked underground\nas water or as ice. Thus, less than 1 percent of fresh water is easily accessible from lakes and rivers. Many living things, such\nas plants, animals, and fungi, are dependent on the small amount of fresh surface water supply, a lack of which can have\nmassive effects on ecosystem dynamics. Humans, of course, have developed technologies to increase water availability,\nsuch as digging wells to harvest groundwater, storing rainwater, and using desalination to obtain drinkable water from the", "d. Humans utilize water from oceans, which is the rarest ecosystem.\nRain and surface runoff are major ways in which minerals, including carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur, are cycled\nfrom land to water. The environmental effects of runoff will be discussed later as these cycles are described.\nFigure 37.15 Water from the land and oceans enters the atmosphere by evaporation or sublimation, where it\ncondenses into clouds and falls as rain or snow. Precipitated water may enter freshwater bodies or infiltrate the soil.\nThe cycle is complete when surface or groundwater reenters the ocean. (credit: modification of work by John M.

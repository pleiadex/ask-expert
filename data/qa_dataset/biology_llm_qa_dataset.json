The female fly lays her eggs in the fruit. The larvae hatch and burrow through the developing fruit. The next year, the adult flies emerge. Prior to the European colonization of North America, the major host of Rhagoletis was a native species of hawthorn, Crataegus marshallii. The domestic apple tree, Malus domestica, is not native to North America, but was imported by European settlers in the late 1700s and early 1800s. When apple trees were first imported into North America, there was no evidence that Rhagoletis could use them as hosts. Apples set fruit earlier in the season and develop faster, where hawthorns set later and develop more slowly. Recent analysis of Rhagoletis populations has shown that two distinct populations of flies have evolved from the original ancestral population of flies that were parasitic on hawthorns. One population infests only apple trees, and the other infests only hawthorns. The life cycles of both fly populations are coordinated with those of their host trees. The flies of each population apparently can distinguish and select mates with similar host preferences and reject mates from the population specific to the other host tree. There is very little hybridization (only about 5 percent) between the two groups. The divergence between the two populations of Rhagoletis must have occurred very rapidly because (A) the apple tree was imported into North America with European settlement approximately 200 years ago (B) flies were imported into North America with European settlement approximately 200 years ago (C) long-distance rail transport of fruit increased only after the American Civil War (1861\u20131865) (D) heavy use of gunpowder during the American Civil War (1861\u20131865) led to increased mutation rates in many natural populations of plants and animals", "Rhagoletis pomonella is a parasitic fly native to North America that infests fruit trees.

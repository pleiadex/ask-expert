The female fly lays her eggs in the fruit. The larvae hatch and burrow through the developing fruit. The next year, the adult flies emerge. Prior to the European colonization of North America, the major host of Rhagoletis was a native species of hawthorn, Crataegus marshallii. The domestic apple tree, Malus domestica, is not native to North America, but was imported by European settlers in the late 1700s and early 1800s. When apple trees were first imported into North America, there was no evidence that Rhagoletis could use them as hosts. Apples set fruit earlier in the season and develop faster, where hawthorns set later and develop more slowly. Recent analysis of Rhagoletis populations has shown that two distinct populations of flies have evolved from the original ancestral population of flies that were parasitic on hawthorns. One population infests only apple trees, and the other infests only hawthorns. The life cycles of both fly populations are coordinated with those of their host trees. The flies of each population apparently can distinguish and select mates with similar host preferences and reject mates from the population specific to the other host tree. There is very little hybridization (only about 5 percent) between the two groups. The divergence between the two populations of Rhagoletis must have occurred very rapidly because (A) the apple tree was imported into North America with European settlement approximately 200 years ago (B) flies were imported into North America with European settlement approximately 200 years ago (C) long-distance rail transport of fruit increased only after the American Civil War (1861\u20131865) (D) heavy use of gunpowder during the American Civil War (1861\u20131865) led to increased mutation rates in many natural populations of plants and animals", "Rhagoletis pomonella is a parasitic fly native to North America that infests fruit trees.

The hypothalamus controls the mechanisms of ADH\nsecretion, either by regulating blood volume or the concentration of water in the blood. Dehydration or physiological stress\ncan cause an increase of osmolarity above 300 mOsm/L, which in turn, raises ADH secretion and water will be retained,\ncausing an increase in blood pressure. ADH travels in the bloodstream to the kidneys. Once at the kidneys, ADH changes\nthe kidneys to become more permeable to water by stimulating the temporary insertion of water channels, aquaporins, into\nthe kidney tubules. Water moves out of the kidney tubules through the aquaporins, reducing urine volume. The water is\nreabsorbed into the capillaries, lowering blood osmolarity back toward normal. As blood osmolarity decreases, a negative\nfeedback mechanism reduces osmoreceptor activity in the hypothalamus, and ADH secretion is reduced. ADH release can", "hormone (ADH) increases membrane permeability to water in the collecting ducts of the nephron by adding aquaporins,\ncausing more water to be reabsorbed. You\u2019ve experienced the effects of ADH when it\u2019s hot outside and you\u2019re running\naround the athletic field; since you\u2019re losing water by sweating and breathing hard, ADH prevents you from losing more\nwater in urine and risking dehydration.\nInformation presented and the examples highlighted in the section support concepts outlined in Big Idea 3 of the AP\u00ae\nBiology Curriculum Framework.

Patients who have Addison's disease have a failing adrenal cortex and cannot produce aldosterone. They lose\nsodium in their urine constantly, and if the supply is not replenished, the consequences can be fatal.\nAntidiurectic Hormone\nAs previously discussed, antidiuretic hormone or ADH (also called vasopressin ), as the name suggests, helps the body\nconserve water when body fluid volume, especially that of blood, is low. It is formed by the hypothalamus and is stored\nand released from the posterior pituitary. It acts by inserting aquaporins in the collecting ducts and promotes reabsorption\nof water. ADH also acts as a vasoconstrictor and increases blood pressure during hemorrhaging.\nAtrial Natriuretic Peptide Hormone\nThe atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) lowers blood pressure by acting as a vasodilator . It is released by cells in the atrium", "levels results in a neuronal signal being sent from the osmoreceptors in hypothalamic nuclei. The pituitary gland has two\ncomponents: anterior and posterior. The anterior pituitary is composed of glandular cells that secrete protein hormones.\nThe posterior pituitary is an extension of the hypothalamus. It is composed largely of neurons that are continuous with the\nhypothalamus.\nThe hypothalamus produces a polypeptide hormone known as antidiuretic hormone (ADH) , which is transported to and\nreleased from the posterior pituitary gland. The principal action of ADH is to regulate the amount of water excreted by the\nkidneys. As ADH (which is also known as vasopressin) causes direct water reabsorption from the kidney tubules, salts and1218 Chapter 28 | The Endocrine System\nThis OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col12078/1.6", "be reduced by certain substances, including alcohol, which can cause increased urine production and dehydration.\nChronic underproduction of ADH or a mutation in the ADH receptor results in diabetes insipidus . If the posterior pituitary\ndoes not release enough ADH, water cannot be retained by the kidneys and is lost as urine. This causes increased thirst, but\nwater taken in is lost again and must be continually consumed. If the condition is not severe, dehydration may not occur,\nbut severe cases can lead to electrolyte imbalances due to dehydration.\nAnother hormone responsible for maintaining electrolyte concentrations in extracellular fluids is aldosterone , a steroid\nhormone that is produced by the adrenal cortex. In contrast to ADH, which promotes the reabsorption of water to maintain\nproper water balance, aldosterone maintains proper water balance by enhancing Na+reabsorption and K+secretion from"], ["Figure 19.2 When populations are in the Hardy\u2013Weinberg equilibrium, the allelic frequency is stable from\ngeneration to generation and the distribution of alleles can be determined from the Hardy\u2013Weinberg equation.
